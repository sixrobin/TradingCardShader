Stylized 3D trading card, made with Unity. The effect is a simple combination of stencil buffer, parallax effect, and some additional visual effects to polish the overall aspect of the cards.
The characters used for the cards are [Alfons Mucha](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfons_Mucha)'s "The Moon and the Stars".
