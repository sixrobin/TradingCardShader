For each card:
	- Extract border.
	- Rescale stencil according to border.
	
	- Split character parts to use parallax/apply wind effects.
	
	- Add custom effects (moon, halo, etc.)
	- Add dust particles/lights.
	- Tweak glass color.
	
	
- Improve secondary textures handling.
- Additive light + stencil shader for "point lights".
- Flower background variant, fitting new textures color more.
- Pole star: add rings as VFX somehow?
- Morning star: add light halo as VFX somehow?
